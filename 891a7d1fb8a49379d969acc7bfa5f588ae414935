      "message": "Here even if we don\u0027t touch it, just by opening MiscExtensions, the default rounded corner gets messed up. It remains like that irrespective of \"use framework values\" turned on or not, only was to fix it is format data or using \"settings put secure sysui_rounded_size -1\" through adb, Probably this issue is coz my device uses drawable for round corners.",
